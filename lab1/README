Purpose: To write functions to compute some basic geometrical calculations.

a) What I learned:
How the Doxygen comment system works and how to write functions properly.

b) Issues I fixed:
I had forgotten for a while to start my Doxygen comments with /** rather than just /*

c) Improvements I made:
Originally the perimeter_triangle() function required 3 parameters, I modified the function to resolve the third value withthe hypotenuse function
