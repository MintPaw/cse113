gdb commands:
	file <file>:
		Loads a file file and symbol table
		If file is unspecified will ask to dumb the current file and symbol table

	backtrace n (bt):
		n specifies how many calls to show
		Reveals the stack frames that got you to the current position

	run <arg> (r):
		Runs the loaded program with specified args

	help <command> (h):
		Provides a short summary of the usage of the command

	break <line/function> <thread> <condition> (b):
		Sets a breakpoint at the line or start of the function on the thread if the condition is true
		The thread and condtion are optional

	continue N (c):
		Continues after a break point skipping N breakpoints

	step N (s):
		Runs the next N lines

	bt full:
		Backtraces all the available stack frames

	print n (p):
		Prints out the value of n

	frame (f):
		Prints out the current stack frame

	kill (k):
		Terminates the program

	next N (n):
		Does the same as step but will step over function calls rather than into them

	info b:
		Prints out all bookmarks

	disable:
		Disables most gdb debugging features

	enable:
		Enables most gdb debugging features

	delete X (d):
		Deletes X, where X can be a breakpoint, bookmark, memory region, checkpoint, or some other objects

	watch n:
		Pauses the program and prints n whenever it changes

	Conditional breakpoints:
		You can set a breakpoint at a certain line or function if a condition is true using the following syntax
			break <line/function> if <condition>
		Example:
			break 10 if strcmp(y, "hello") == 0
