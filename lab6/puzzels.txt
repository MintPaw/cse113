1. 
	x=2		y=-1	z=1
	x=2		y=2		z=1
	x=2		y=2		z=2
	x=0		y=-1	z=0
	x=0		y=0		z=-1
	x=0		y=-1	z=-1

2. Function names cannot have dashes like "OS_HP-UX_print()"

3. It stdio.h was included it would just print the value 1 as you would only go through the loop once.

4. It will be 1.1f because the loop loops 10 times and the value starts at 0.1f

5. Obviously it's the 1,2 although I'm not sure what that's intended to be.

6. 40, an int it 4 bytes and there are 10 of them, so 40.

7. The extra space captures the space left in the buffer after the previous scanf, if it is removed then c will end up being a space character regardless.

8. 
	i : 10
	sizeof(i++) is: 4
	i : 11

9. printf ("The date you have entered is %2d-%2d-%2d\n", day, month, year);

10. for (i = 0; -i < n; i--)

11. a is not initialized so most likely an error, although it may be an arbitrary number

12. 8, the first test will fail and incitement i, the second test will succeed also incitementing i and invalidating the third test
