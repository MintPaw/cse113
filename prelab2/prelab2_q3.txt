I much prefer 'if' to 'case', in the examples the 'case' is easier for me to read than the 'if'.
But if the 'if' example was written using one liners it would become easier.

I don't believe one liner ifs are less error prone than case as it's easy to forget the break
Also the lack of braces looks really jarring to me

Case is just like if except the word 'if' is changed to 'case'
The opening brace is changed to ':' and the ending brace is changed to 'default'

'if/else' is way easier to interpret than 'switch/case/default' from a language point of view.
Case is far more limited than if. You can only make an equality comparison between integers.
The only new thing case allows you to do is to be able to skip the break an run multiple cases.
Which I personally have never found a uses for
